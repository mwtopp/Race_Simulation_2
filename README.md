# Race_Simulation_2
This project is a development of the previous Race_Simulation_1 project. The purpose is to develop a simulation of a motor race. This project adds competitor cars to the simulation and manages race position and overtaking.

The objective of the simulation is to determine the optimal lap for a competitor in a motor race to stop for a pit-stop.
